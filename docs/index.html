<!-- Description -->
<div>
	<h1>Maracas</h1>
	<p>
		Maracas is a source code and bytecode analysis framework—written in Rascal and Java—that is designed to support the co-evolution of Java Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and client code. Maracas relies on japicmp to compute the list of breaking changes between two API versions. Afterwards, it is able to identify declarations within a client project that are impacted by the aforementioned breaking changes (a.k.a. detections).
