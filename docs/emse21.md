title: Breaking Bad?
---

The content presented in this website accompanies the paper "Breaking Bad? Semantic Versioning and Impact of Breaking Changes in Maven Central" authored by Lina Ochoa, Thomas Degueule, Jean-Rémy Falleri, and Jurgen Vinju.
The study is an external and differentiated replication study of the paper ["Semantic Versioning and Impact of Breaking Changes in the Maven Repository"](https://jstvssr.github.io/assets/pdf/semantic-versioning-maven.pdf) presented by Steven Raemaekers, Arie van Deursen, and Joost Visser.

## Breaking Changes and Detections
In the study, we consider 31 types of breaking changes as reported on the Java Language Specification Java SE 8 Edition, and the blog post ["Evolving Java-based APIs"](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Evolving_Java-based_APIs) authored by Jim Des Rivières.
We rely on [japicmp](https://siom79.github.io/japicmp/) to extract these changes from Java bytecode.

Details on how we detect these breaking changes are provided [here](https://crossminer.github.io/maracas/detections/).

## Maracas

* [Source code](https://github.com/crossminer/maracas)
* [Detections test suite](https://github.com/crossminer/maracas/tree/master/maracas/src/org/maracas/test/delta/japicmp/detections)
* [Accuracy checker](https://github.com/crossminer/maracas/blob/master/maracas/src/org/maracas/groundtruth/jezek/Groundtruth.rsc) against [our extended version of Jezek et al.'s benchmark](https://github.com/lmove/api-evolution-data-corpus)

## Datasets and Notebooks

* The [maven-api-dataset repository](https://github.com/tdegueul/maven-api-dataset/) (warning: > 2GB) contains:
  * [Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/tdegueul/maven-api-dataset/tree/master/notebooks/final) for every research question and both datasets (MDD and MDG). They can be used to play with the data, re-generate the paper's figures, and run the statistical tests
  * [The code used to compute the datasets, deltas, and detections](https://github.com/tdegueul/maven-api-dataset/blob/master/code/cypher-queries/src/main/java/mcr/BuildDataset.java)
  * CSV files containing [the annotations extracted from the top-1000 most popular libraries on Maven Central](https://github.com/tdegueul/maven-api-dataset/blob/master/code/cypher-queries/data/annotations.csv), the [148,253 artefacts extracted from the MDD](https://github.com/tdegueul/maven-api-dataset/blob/master/code/cypher-queries/data/mdd-libraries.csv), and the [most popular version suffixes in the MDG](https://github.com/tdegueul/maven-api-dataset/blob/master/code/cypher-queries/data/version-suffixes.csv) 
  * [CSV files containing the raw data used to answer every research question](https://github.com/tdegueul/maven-api-dataset/tree/master/code/cypher-queries/data/gen), automatically generated by our analysis scripts, imported and analyzed in the notebooks
