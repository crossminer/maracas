title: Breaking Bad? Semantic Versioning and Impact of Breaking Changes in Maven Central
---

The content presented in this website accompanies the paper "Breaking Bad? Semantic Versioning and Impact of Breaking Changes in Maven Central" authored by Lina Ochoa, Thomas Degueule, Jean-Rémy Falleri, and Jurgen Vinju. The paper was submitted and accepted in the Journal of Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE'21). This study is an external and differentiated replication study of the paper ["Semantic Versioning and Impact of Breaking Changes in the Maven Repository"](https://jstvssr.github.io/assets/pdf/semantic-versioning-maven.pdf) presented by Steven Raemaekers, Arie van Deursen, and Joost Visser.

## Breaking Changes and Detections
In the study, we consider 31 types of breaking changes as reported on the Java Language Specification Java SE 8 Edition, and the blog post ["Evolving Java-based APIs"](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Evolving_Java-based_APIs) authored by Jim Des Rivières.
We rely on [japicmp](https://siom79.github.io/japicmp/) to extract these changes from Java bytecode.

* Interface added
* Interface removed
* Class less accessible
* Class no longer public
* Class now abstract
* Class now final
* Class removed
* Class type changed
* Constructor less accessible
* Constructor removed
* Field less accessible
* Field more accessible
* Field no longer static
* Field now final
* Field now static
* Field removed
* Field type changed
* Method abstract added to class
* Method abstract now default
* Method added to interface
* Method less accessible
* Method more accessible
* Method new default
* Method no longer static
* Method now abstract
* Method now final
* Method now static
* Method removed
* Method return type changed
* Superclass added
* Superclass removed

Details on how we detect these breaking changes are provided [here](https://crossminer.github.io/maracas/detections/).

## Maracas

* [Source code](https://github.com/crossminer/maracas)
* [Detections test suite](https://github.com/crossminer/maracas/tree/master/maracas/src/org/maracas/test/delta/japicmp/detections)
* [Accuracy checker](https://github.com/crossminer/maracas/blob/master/maracas/src/org/maracas/groundtruth/jezek/Groundtruth.rsc) against [our extended version of Jezek et al.'s benchmark](https://github.com/lmove/api-evolution-data-corpus)

## Corpora
* **Maven Dependency Dataset (MDD):** This corpus is a snapshot of Maven Central Repository (MCR). It was introduced by Raemaekers et al. in [this paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6624031) and it can be downloaded from [here](https://data.4tu.nl/articles/dataset/The_Maven_Dependency_Dataset/12698027/1).
* **Maven Dependency Graph (MDG):** This corpus is a snapshot of MCR 2018. It was introduced by Benelalla et al. in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05392) and it can be found at [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/1489120).

## Datasets and Notebooks
The main datasets and notebooks used for this study are contained inn the [maven-api-dataset repository](https://github.com/tdegueul/maven-api-dataset/) (warning: > 2GB). This repository contains:

* [Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/tdegueul/maven-api-dataset/tree/master/notebooks/) for every research question and both corpora (MDD and MDG). They can be used to play with the data, re-generate the paper's figures, and run the statistical tests.
* [The code used to compute the datasets, deltas, and detections](https://github.com/tdegueul/maven-api-dataset/blob/master/code/cypher-queries/src/main/java/mcr/BuildDataset.java).
* CSV files containing [the annotations extracted from the top-1000 most popular libraries on Maven Central](https://github.com/tdegueul/maven-api-dataset/blob/master/code/cypher-queries/data/annotations.csv), the [148,253 artefacts extracted from the MDD](https://github.com/tdegueul/maven-api-dataset/blob/master/code/cypher-queries/data/mdd-libraries.csv), and the [most popular version suffixes in the MDG](https://github.com/tdegueul/maven-api-dataset/blob/master/code/cypher-queries/data/version-suffixes.csv).
* [CSV files containing the raw data used to answer every research question](https://github.com/tdegueul/maven-api-dataset/tree/master/code/cypher-queries/data/gen), automatically generated by our analysis scripts, imported and analyzed in the notebooks.
